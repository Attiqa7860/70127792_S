I had make 3 html pages with 1 external css. In other 2 pages, I had use internal css.
I had add three navigation(Portfolio,About me,Contact me) which are included in header.
As,I had provide Introduction in About me thats why I had not given much details in Header.
In Footer,I was trying to add logo so i could go to linkedin profile but i failed to attempt it.Thats why I had mentioned Linkedin Name
I had concept of html but less concept of CSS. I always confuse in margin and padding.But ,I am trying to improve my skills.
